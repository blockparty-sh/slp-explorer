# Translations

It is very important people can learn about SLP in their native language. We have used i18next to be able to provide translations on the site for users.


## Translating Site

If you would like to contribute to translating this site:

* Copy `lang/en.json` to a new file. 
* Translate the values in the file after the ":" symbol
* Open a PR or issue here, or contact `@Blockparty_Sh` on Telegram

## Fixing Error

If you noticed something that could be worded better:

* Look inside the `lang` folder for the corresponding [language code](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/)
* Search for the phrase that has error
* Open a PR or issue here, or contact `@Blockparty_Sh` on Telegram with the fixed line.
